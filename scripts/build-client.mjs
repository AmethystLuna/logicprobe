/**
 * Publish this package's browser half as `lib/client.js`.
 *
 * The client bundle is hand-authored in the module-system format the dsh Web
 * client loads (`window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id, factory })`), which `tsc`
 * does not emit: a factory-form bundle needs a synchronous `require`, a single
 * file whose whole body sits inside the factory closure, and an `id` that is
 * the package's resolved npm name. So the build copies the authored source
 * verbatim, and CI's committed-`lib/` drift guard keeps the two in step.
