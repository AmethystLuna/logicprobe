# DSH Compatibility Evidence — Logic Probe

Evidence for the DSH STORE fixed-Commit contract: per-release install / start /
uninstall verification of this plugin's native dsh bundle against the DSH
releases listed in `dsh.compatibility.dshReleases` (author-remediation track
[AI-Scarlett/DSH-Store#252](https://github.com/AI-Scarlett/DSH-Store/issues/252)).

## Environment

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Host | Windows 11 (x64), build 19045 |
| Node.js | v22.22.3 |
| npm | 10.9.8 |
| pnpm | 11.21.0 |
| Test date | 2026-09-03 |
| Package under test | `dsh-logicprobe` 0.6.0 (bundle patch `cordis.patch.yml`, entry id `logicprobe`) |

## Method (one disposable profile per version)

Each DSH release was run from its own runtime (global CLI for
0.1.0-rc.7 … 0.1.2-alpha.3; temporary npm install under an isolated prefix for
0.1.2-alpha.4, 0.1.2-alpha.5, and 0.1.2-rc.1) against a fresh `DSH_HOME`, so
no state leaked between versions:

```bash
# 1) install: fresh profile, plugin added as a file: dependency
dsh plugin --profile headless add "file:<this-repo>"      # pnpm add succeeds

# 2) mount check: composed tree contains the plugin row, enabled
dsh --profile headless --dump-config                       # id: logicprobe / enabled: true

# 3) start: headless boot with a deliberately invalid API key.
#    Expected: tree mounts and the app reaches the model-provider stage,
#    failing only with AUTH for the fake key; no plugin load errors.
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=fake-key-for-boot-test dsh --profile headless "reply OK"

# 4) uninstall: plugin removed, row gone from the composed tree
dsh plugin --profile headless remove dsh-logicprobe
dsh --profile headless --dump-config                       # no logicprobe row
```

The headless `AUTH` rejection proves the profile booted with the plugin applied
(any bundle apply error would surface before the provider call). End-to-end
model calls were not exercised (no real provider key used).

## Results

| dsh release | install | dump-config row | start (headless boot) | uninstall |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.1.0-rc.7 | pass | pass | pass (AUTH-only) | pass |
| 0.1.0-rc.8 | pass | pass | pass (AUTH-only) | pass |
| 0.1.1-rc.1 | pass | pass | pass (AUTH-only) | pass |
| 0.1.1-rc.2 | pass | pass | pass (AUTH-only) | pass |
| 0.1.2-alpha.2 | pass | pass | pass (AUTH-only) | pass |
| 0.1.2-alpha.3 | pass | pass | pass (AUTH-only) | pass |
| 0.1.2-alpha.4 | pass | pass | pass (AUTH-only) | pass |
| 0.1.2-alpha.5 | pass | pass | pass (AUTH-only) | pass |
| 0.1.2-rc.1 | pass | pass | pass (AUTH-only) | pass |

## Notes

- DSH 0.1.2-alpha.4 removed the `Session.events` getter and replaced it with
  on-demand reads (`seq` / `eventAt()` / `snapshotEvents()`). 0.6.0 reads
  session history through a version-adaptive helper (`readSessionEvents`) that
  prefers `snapshotEvents()` when present and falls back to the `events`
  snapshot on earlier releases, so the gate injection keeps working on every
  declared DSH release. Regression-checked with harnessed `agent/pre-step`
  runs against both session event-source shapes (12/12 pass) in addition to
  the per-release boot matrix above.
- DSH 0.1.2-alpha.5 (session-projection cache v6 read compatibility and
  storage salvage) and 0.1.2-rc.1 (release-candidate stabilization on top of
  alpha.5) do not change the plugin-facing seams this bundle relies on
  (`agent/pre-step`, `Session` event reads, `ctx.tools`/provider
  registration); verified per release with the disposable-profile matrix above
  (0.6.0 keeps 0.1.0-rc.7 … 0.1.2-rc.1 working).
- 0.5.5 is deprecated on npm with a warning pointing to 0.5.6 (npmjs blocks
  `npm unpublish` for automation tokens under its 2FA write policy): its
  `dsh.compatibility.dsh` range (`^0.1.2-alpha.3`) admitted 0.1.2-alpha.4
  while that bundle predated the alpha.4 session API fix. 0.6.0 continues the
  same session-adapter lineage and is published as `latest`.
- `dsh.engines.dsh` is `>=0.1.0-rc.7`, matching the verified rc.7 result.
- Windows-only evidence; other platforms were not exercised.
