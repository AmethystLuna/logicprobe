# DSH Compatibility Evidence — Logic Probe

Evidence for the DSH STORE fixed-Commit contract: per-release install / start /
uninstall verification of this plugin's native dsh bundle against the DSH
releases listed in `dsh.compatibility.dshReleases` (author-remediation track
[AI-Scarlett/DSH-Store#252](https://github.com/AI-Scarlett/DSH-Store/issues/252)).

## Environment

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Host | Windows 11 (x64), build 19045 |
| Node.js | v22.22.3 |
| npm | 10.9.8 |
| pnpm | 11.21.0 |
| Test date | 2026-09-11 |
| Package under test | `dsh-logicprobe` 0.6.5 (bundle patch `cordis.patch.yml`, entry id `logicprobe`) |

## Method (one disposable profile per version)

Each DSH release was run from its own runtime (global CLI for
0.1.0-rc.7 … 0.1.2-alpha.3; temporary npm install under an isolated prefix for
0.1.2-alpha.4 through 0.1.5-rc.2) against a fresh `DSH_HOME`, so no state
leaked between versions. 0.1.3-alpha.1 predates its npm publish, so it ran from
a local pnpm workspace build of git tag `dsh-v0.1.3-alpha.1`; every later row was
installed from its published npm release. The `fs-ext` native dependency
introduced in 0.1.3 (cross-process session write lease) is a POSIX `flock` shim
that the Windows lease path never calls — it takes a kernel semaphore instead —
so the two 0.1.3 rows ran with `fs-ext` substituted by a no-op stub on this
MSVC-less host (`npm install --ignore-scripts`). 0.1.5-alpha.1 replaced `fs-ext`
with the lazily loaded prebuilt `@deepseek-ai/node-addon-system/flock`, so that
row installed exactly as published.

```bash
# 1) install: fresh profile, plugin added as a file: dependency
dsh plugin --profile headless add "file:<this-repo>"      # pnpm add succeeds

# 2) mount check: composed tree contains the plugin row, enabled
dsh --profile headless --dump-config                       # id: logicprobe / enabled: true

# 3) start: headless boot with a deliberately invalid API key.
#    Expected: tree mounts and the app reaches the model-provider stage,
#    failing only with AUTH for the fake key; no plugin load errors.
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=fake-key-for-boot-test dsh --profile headless "reply OK"

# 4) uninstall: plugin removed, row gone from the composed tree
dsh plugin --profile headless remove dsh-logicprobe
dsh --profile headless --dump-config                       # no logicprobe row
```

The headless `AUTH` rejection proves the profile booted with the plugin applied
(any bundle apply error would surface before the provider call). End-to-end
model calls were not exercised (no real provider key used).

For the 0.1.3-alpha.2 row the boot was additionally inspected at the session-log
level: the persisted v2 log (`session.v2.jsonl.zstd`) records the injected gate
as a `user/message` event with `data.source = {"kind":"plugin",
"plugin":"logicprobe"}`, and the system-prompt snapshot in the same log carries
the plugin's `logicprobe:mode` context section. That proves the `agent/pre-step`
hook ran, its `Session` snapshot read resolved, and the prompt-context
registration still assembles on the new release. The 0.1.5-alpha.1 row repeated
that inspection against the v3 log (`session.v3.jsonl.zstd`, a multi-frame zstd
stream): the gate is recorded the same way, the rendered prompt now lives in a
`system/message` surface node, and the runtime-context `user/message` still
carries the `logicprobe:mode` section. The 0.1.5-alpha.2, 0.1.5-rc.1 and 0.1.5-rc.2 rows repeated the same v3 inspection with the same result.

## Notes

- DSH 0.1.2-alpha.4 removed the `Session.events` getter and replaced it with
  on-demand reads (`seq` / `eventAt()` / `snapshotEvents()`). 0.6.0 reads
  session history through a version-adaptive helper (`readSessionEvents`) that
  prefers `snapshotEvents()` when present and falls back to the `events`
  snapshot on earlier releases, so the gate injection keeps working on every
  declared DSH release. Regression-checked with harnessed `agent/pre-step`
  runs against both session event-source shapes (12/12 pass) in addition to
  the per-release boot matrix above.
- DSH 0.1.2-alpha.5 (session-projection cache v6 read compatibility and
  storage salvage) and 0.1.2-rc.1 (release-candidate stabilization on top of
  alpha.5) do not change the plugin-facing seams this bundle relies on
  (`agent/pre-step`, `Session` event reads, `ctx.tools`/provider
  registration); verified per release with the disposable-profile matrix above
  (0.6.0 keeps 0.1.0-rc.7 … 0.1.2-rc.1 working).
- DSH 0.1.3-alpha.1 (session format v2 with released migration, embedded
  assistant streams, and the new `agent/assistant-stream` live event) does not
  change the plugin-facing seams this bundle relies on (`agent/pre-step`,
  `Session` snapshot event reads, `ctx.skills`/`ctx.tools` registration);
  `assistant/chunk` log events were removed in v2 but this bundle never reads
  them. Verified per release with the disposable-profile matrix above (0.6.1
  keeps 0.1.0-rc.7 … 0.1.3-alpha.1 working). The 0.1.3-alpha.1 row ran a local
  source build of the git tag with the new `fs-ext` native dependency stubbed
  out on this no-MSVC host (see Method); 0.1.3-alpha.2 re-verified the same
  seams from the published npm release.
- DSH 0.1.3-alpha.2 (persona configuration split into prefix/suffix, default
  read/write/edit file tools for SDK/Headless/ACP, and subprocess handles
  dropping `pid`) renames `PERSONA_SECTION` to `PERSONA_PREFIX_SECTION` and
  replaces `Config.persona` with `personaPrefix`/`personaSuffix`, but this
  bundle never reads the persona slot — it registers its own `logicprobe:mode`
  prompt-context section, which still assembles (visible in the recorded session
  log) — and it touches neither subprocess handles nor the `agent/pre-step` /
  `Session` snapshot seams. `Session.fromRestore` gained a fifth `eventState`
  parameter and `dsh-session` dropped its internal `chunk-rows` exports; this
  bundle uses neither. Verified with the disposable-profile matrix above plus
  the session-log gate evidence (0.6.2 keeps 0.1.0-rc.7 … 0.1.3-alpha.2
  working).
- DSH 0.1.5-alpha.1 (session format v3, the `system/message` surface node that
  now carries the rendered system prompt, the released v2-to-v3 migration, the
  `tool/code-dispatch*` → `tool/ptc-dispatch*` rename, and stricter event
  validation) does not change the plugin-facing seams this bundle relies on
  (`agent/pre-step`, `Session` snapshot event reads, `ctx.skills`/`ctx.tools`
  registration, `systemPrompt.context`). The stricter validation constrains
  only `request/header` and `tool/result`, while `user/message` still projects
  verbatim, so the injected gate remains valid; the `logicprobe:mode` context
  still assembles into the runtime-context message. `fs-ext` was replaced by
  the lazily loaded prebuilt `@deepseek-ai/node-addon-system/flock`, so this row
  installed from the published npm release as-is. Verified with the
  disposable-profile matrix plus the v3 session-log gate evidence (0.6.3 keeps
  0.1.0-rc.7 … 0.1.5-alpha.1 working).
- DSH 0.1.5-rc.1 (release-candidate stabilization over alpha.1: 198 commits
  dominated by Web/Client sidebar, file-preview, diagram and workspace-files
  work; additive `deliverables/presented` and `subagent/catalog` event types;
  an optional `LlmConfigurableProvider.error` diagnostic; `chokidar` added to
  app-boot) keeps session format v3 and leaves the `agent/pre-step`, `Session`
  snapshot, `ctx.skills`/`ctx.tools`, `systemPrompt.context` and `createUserMessage`
  seams unchanged. Verified with the disposable-profile matrix plus the v3
  session-log gate evidence (0.6.4 keeps 0.1.0-rc.7 … 0.1.5-rc.1 working).
- DSH 0.1.5-alpha.2 (185 commits on the same Web/Client stabilization line;
  its plugin-facing delta matches the rc.1 row) and 0.1.5-rc.2 (a two-commit
  version-bump-only release over rc.1) keep session format v3 and leave the
  `agent/pre-step`, `Session` snapshot,
  `ctx.skills`/`ctx.tools`, `systemPrompt.context` and `createUserMessage`
  seams unchanged. Verified with the disposable-profile matrix plus the v3
  session-log gate evidence (0.6.5 keeps 0.1.0-rc.7 … 0.1.5-rc.2 working).
- 0.5.5 is deprecated on npm with a warning pointing to 0.5.6 (npmjs blocks
  `npm unpublish` for automation tokens under its 2FA write policy): its
  `dsh.compatibility.dsh` range (`^0.1.2-alpha.3`) admitted 0.1.2-alpha.4
  while that bundle predated the alpha.4 session API fix. 0.6.0 continues the
  same session-adapter lineage and is published as `latest`.
- `dsh.engines.dsh` is `>=0.1.0-rc.7`, matching the verified rc.7 result.
- Windows-only evidence; other platforms were not exercised.
