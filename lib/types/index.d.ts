/**
 * logicprobe — DeepSeek Harness native plugin for the Logic Probe toolbox.
 * Injects the session-start gate text (claim-verification doctrine, 1% Rule,
 * Red Flags, proactive suggestion) into the first model step of every agent
 * session, mirroring the SessionStart hook the Claude Code plugin installs.
 * The skill ships in this package's `skills/` directory and is registered at
 * apply time into dsh's `ctx.skills` registry through the standard filesystem
 * provider, so it appears in every session catalog without a manual copy step.
 *
 * Injection listens on the official `agent/session-start` lifecycle event
 * (once before the first turn) and seeds the gate via `agent.inject`, so
 * the text enters durable context before the first request — the dsh-native
 * counterpart of the Claude SessionStart matcher (startup|clear|compact;
 * resume keeps the gate already in history). The default gate text is the
 * dsh-native adaptation of `hooks/session-start-content.md`: behavior rules
 * (1% Rule / Red Flags / proactive suggestion) stay in sync, while
 * presentation is adapted to dsh's native skill catalog — the trigger list
 * lives in the skill description, not duplicated in the gate. Deployments
 * override via Config.
 *
 * @module logicprobe-dsh
